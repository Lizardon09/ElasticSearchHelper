Serves to experiment with the implimentation idea of utilizing the 'NEST' library to provide refined additonal high level 
assistance with setup and interactions with an elastic instance for more casual users. It takes advantage of query based elastic 
requests provided by 'NEST', and breaks the aspects and building blocks of the descriptors for those queries into manipulatable containers
that can be used to define higher level logic and operations for casual interactions with elastic.

Dependencies:

    NEST
    Elastic
